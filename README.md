# UPI Payment Fraud Detection & Analysis

## Project Overview
Analyzed 6.3 million+ real-world UPI payment transactions to identify fraud patterns, behavioral signatures, and risk indicators using Python and Power BI.

## Key Findings
- Only 0.13% transactions are fraudulent — highly imbalanced dataset
- Fraud occurs ONLY in TRANSFER & CASH_OUT transaction types
- Fraud transactions are 8X larger than legitimate ones (Avg: ₹14.67L vs ₹1.78L)
- 98% of fraud victims had their accounts completely drained
- ₹51.32 Million total amount lost to fraud
- Fraud peaks at hour 212 (Day 8-9) of transaction activity

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI
- Dataset: PaySim - 6.3M transactions
